		<h2>Connecting food lovers with local people that love cooking. </h2> 

		<p> The way it works is instead of asking GrubHub to quickly deliver some MSG-filled chinese food by City Food, have it made with love and care by Xuexie, a graduate linguistics student who grew up in China and has interesting thoughts on contemporary Chinese state capitalism. Oh, you work at a bank and are interested in economics? Great! </p>

		<p> Our technology prioritizes similarity of interests and compatibility using deep-learning algorithms which allows cooks and eaters to hit it off, and become friends! </p>
